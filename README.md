# Detection-of-SSH-password-guessing-attacks-using-classification-algorithms
This project aims to develop a resilient SSH attack detection system using classification algorithms like LSTM, Deep Belief Network, One-Dimensional CNN, Random Forest, etc. Despite challenges in obtaining sufficient training data, the project collects malicious SSH password guessing attacks and legitimate PCAP files from trusted sources like CIC-IDS (Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity). The process involves organizing and preparing the data, extracting relevant features, and training 16 selected classification algorithms using an ensemble learning method, with XGBoost for model integration. The resultant system achieves improved accuracy, successfully distinguishing between normal SSH traffic and SSH password guessing attack traffic, thereby enhancing overall server security.
